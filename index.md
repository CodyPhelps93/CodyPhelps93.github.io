## Artifact 1:
This artifact is an android application that I developed from the design phase to the current product. The application is a weight tracking application that allows different users to login and track their weight. It uses a SQLite database to hold the data locally on the device. This artifact will serve as showing two enhancements the first being in 
'''Software Engineering and Design'''  and then '''Algorthims and data structures'''
