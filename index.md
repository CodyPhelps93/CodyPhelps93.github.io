# Code Review
This code review showcases my ability to debug and look for security issues within the projects that I've seleted. Computer science professionals should be able to do this as it can improve: 
- Code Quality
- Help with Consistency
- Enhance Colaboration and Communication

## Artifact 1:
This artifact is an android application that I developed from the design phase to the current product. The application is a weight tracking application that allows different users to login and track their weight. It uses a SQLite database to hold the data locally on the device. This artifact will serve as showing two enhancements the first being in 
```Software Engineering and Design```
and then
```Algorithms and data structures```
This artifact orginally used 4 views: 
- Login View
- Create Account View
- Weight Tracking View
- SMS Permission View

This caused a clutter of different objects on the view and was not user friendly. This will take us to the first enhancement which is for software engineering and design.
You can see the code for before and after here:

## Software Engineering and Design:
For this enhancement I chose to refactor the entire UI/UX of the application. This would take away the clutter and make the application more user friendly as well as adding a better sense of navigation. With this enhancement I decided to include
a calorie tracker so that the user had a way of seeing their progress in a different way. The calorie tracker view also takes the users calorie deficit and lets the user know how much weight they have either gained or loss.
